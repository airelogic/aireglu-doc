The recipient, the subject, and (optionally) the message. While possible to send blank emails, this is not recommended.</p><p>The recipient&#39;s email address should be added to the <code>To</code> or <code>BCC</code> field, and the subject added to the <code>Subject</code> field. You may add multiple email addresses separated by semi-colons. The message, or body of the email can be created using the Text Editor. If you need to send this as a Plaintext email, change the <code>Email format</code> dropdown selection to <code>Plain Text</code>.</p><h2 id="attachments" tabindex="-1">Attachments <a class="header-anchor" href="#attachments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Attachments&quot;">​</a></h2><p>You can add an attachment to the email in one of two ways. You can either use the base64 version of a file (e.g. the output of the <a href="./pdf.html">PDF Task</a>), or upload a file that&#39;s reused each time an email is sent. If you are using the base64 option, you should specify the MIME type and filename. If we are attaching a PDF document, these values might be set to <code>application/pdf</code> and <code>results.pdf</code> respectively. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">A list of common MIME types can be found here.</a></p><p>If you are uploading a file, you do not need to specify these, as they can be automatically determined from the file.</p><p>If your attachment needs to change each each time you run the endpoint, you should use the base64 option. You can either generate the files in AireGlu, send them as part of the input, or download them using the <a href="./http-request.html">HTTP Request</a> and <a href="./http-response-handler.html">HTTP Response Handler</a> tasks.</p><h2 id="custom-smtp" tabindex="-1">Custom SMTP <a class="header-anchor" href="#custom-smtp" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Custom SMTP&quot;">​</a></h2><p>By default, AireGlu will send emails from <code>aireglu@airelogic.com</code> with no configuration required. Sometimes however, you may need to send emails from a different address, for example, from your own domain (<code>surveys@yoursite.com</code>). There are two ways to accomplish this. You can set this for your whole account, or for specific tasks.</p><h3 id="account-wide" tabindex="-1">Account-wide <a class="header-anchor" href="#account-wide" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Account-wide&quot;">​</a></h3><p>If you want to change the default email settings for all endpoints you create, then you can change these under your account settings. Click the person icon in the top right, and choose My Account. Then tick the <code>Use custom SMTP</code> box. This should be filled in using information provided by your email provider. Typically, it is the same information you might use when configuring an email client such as Outlook or Thunderbird.</p><h3 id="per-task" tabindex="-1">Per Task <a class="header-anchor" href="#per-task" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Per Task&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Per task settings can be found by selecting the <code>Advanced Settings</code> tab and scrolling down to the <code>SMTP Settings</code> section when configuring your Email task. This should be filled in using information provided by your email provider. Typically, it is the same information you might use when configuring an email client such as Outlook or Thunderbird.</p>',15),n=[s];function d(r,c,l,h,m,u){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const y=e(i,[["render",d]]);export{f as __pageData,y as default};
