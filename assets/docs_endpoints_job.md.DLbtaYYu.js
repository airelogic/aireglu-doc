From here you can name the job, select the endpoint you want to run, what data it should have, and set the schedule. You can also set <code>Disable on failure</code>, to turn the job off if it doesn&#39;t work. You can always turn it back on manually later. When defining the job name, you should try and ensure it will be unique. The name and the endpoint data can both accept fields from the context panel.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="Creating a job"><br> For setting the schedule, you can either use the wizard options to set a pattern, or use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">cron expression</a>.
