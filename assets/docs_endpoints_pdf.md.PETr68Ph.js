Optionally, you can combine this with an existing document by adding an existing document before or after the generated content. The output of this task can be used from the Context panel in subsequent tasks.</p><h2 id="creating-a-pdf-document" tabindex="-1">Creating a PDF Document <a class="header-anchor" href="#creating-a-pdf-document" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Creating a PDF Document&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Simple PDF generation can be accomplished by using the Rich Text editor to design the layout for the content, and the Context Panel to insert data.</p><p>For advanced users or layouts, you can change the <code>Format</code> dropdown selection to <code>HTML (Raw)</code>. Using this method, you can accomplish much more complex designs for the PDF, and include features not available to the Text Editor mode. Examples of this include tables, images, colours, and other layout controls.</p><p>Additional options are available to format your PDF content. These are:</p><ul><li>Remove Margins</li><li>Landscape (default is portrait)</li><li>Scale factor - this adjusts the size of the content. 1 = 100% (normal size), 0.5 = 50% (half size), 2 = 200% (double size)</li></ul><h2 id="combining-documents" tabindex="-1">Combining Documents <a class="header-anchor" href="#combining-documents" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Combining Documents&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Another use for this task is to add content to an existing document. An example of this may be adding a static coversheet to the results of a survey submitted by AireForms. To do this, you should use options on the <code>Advanced Settings</code> tab under <code>Attachment Settings</code> to insert the base64 version of the existing PDF, and choose whether you want to Append or Prepend it to your new content (PDF Content).</p><p>Using this method, you can also chain multiple PDF tasks.</p>',10),i=[s];function d(c,r,l,h,u,m){return o(),t("div",null,i)}const g=e(n,[["render",d]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
